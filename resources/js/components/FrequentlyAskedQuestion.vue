        answer:
            'LoreSpinner is an interactive storytelling platform where you step inside authored story worlds and help shape what happens next. Each experience begins with a story created by human writers. From there, your choices and imagination guide the journey. You can choose a path, make decisions, or tell the story what you want to do, and the world responds in real time.',

        answer:
            'No. LoreSpinner is not a free-for-all story editor. You can make choices, explore different paths, and influence how the experience unfolds, but the core characters, world, and story integrity remain protected. Think of it as stepping inside a story, not rewriting someone else\'s book.',

            'LoreSpinner works with selected writers, creators, and story partners. If you are interested in creating with us, you can reach out through our community or contact channels. As we grow, we plan to open more ways for writers to bring stories into LoreSpinner.',
    },
    {
        id: '4',
        question: 'Can users generate images or artwork on the platform?',
        answer:
            'Not in Alpha. LoreSpinner is focused on story, choice, and immersive narrative experiences. Visuals may appear as part of the world, memory, or journey, but the platform is not designed as an image-generation tool.',
