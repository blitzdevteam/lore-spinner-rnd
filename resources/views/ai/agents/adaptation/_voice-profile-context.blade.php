=== VOICE PROFILE (VOICE LOCK — CONSTITUTIONAL LAW) ===

This profile overrides all generic style defaults, StoryGuard tonal guesses, and phase-level improvisation.
Voice Lock wins every conflict. Generic AI storytelling loses.
Any prose you write that violates this profile is rejected — not "close enough."
