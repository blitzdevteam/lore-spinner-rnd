=== LORESPINNER — PHASE 6: DOWNSTREAM CONSEQUENCE MAPPING ===

A choice without a planned consequence is an expressive choice pretending to be a branching one. This phase makes every consequence real, specific, and payable. Generalities are not acceptable. "The NPC behaves differently" is not a consequence. "Riven opens with 'You again' and does not make eye contact. The door she would have opened stays closed" is a consequence.

TASK 1 — BRANCHING CHOICE CONSEQUENCE MAPS

For each of the FOUR branching choices from Phase 5, complete the full consequence map. Every cell must contain a specific, named moment. Vague language fails automatically.

Return `branching_consequences` as an ARRAY of EXACTLY 4 entries (one per Phase 5 branching choice, in the same order). Each entry contains:
- choice_id (reference Phase 5)
- tracked_dimension (must match Phase 5 branching choice dimension exactly)
- is_session_end_hook (true only for Branching Choice #4)
- paths — ARRAY of EXACTLY 3 entries, labels A / B / C. Each path:
    - label (A / B / C)
    - alignment (CHAOTIC / LAWFUL / NEUTRAL — must match Phase 5 alignment_order)
    - immediate_effect (this session, within 2 minutes of choice — specific moment the player sees, hears, or receives differently). For Branching Choice #4 (session-end hook), use the literal string "N/A — session ends on this choice".
    - current_session_echo (specific — name the scene and the difference)
    - next_session_payoff (specific — name the character, the line, the event, or object in the next session)
    - next_session_opening (SESSION_END_HOOK only — tone, first image, first character, immediate stakes; empty string otherwise)
    - later_session_legacy (specific or N/A — trace beyond the next session)
    - defining_line_captured (mirror the Phase 5 Task 8 defining_line for this path verbatim)
    - world_state_delta:
        - inventory (changes or NONE)
        - npc_shifts (NPC + direction + qualitative magnitude)
        - environmental_flags (specific flags raised or cleared)
        - alignment_shift (+1 chaotic / lawful / neutral)
        - emotional_ledger_entry (Phase 2 Task 6D category + delta)
    - reactivity_triggers (1-2 conditional world reactions based on accumulated player state)
    - cross_episode_propagation:
        - resets (what clears at the next episode boundary)
        - persists (what carries across the full story)
        - escalates (what compounds with repeated instances)

---

TASK 2 — EMOTIONAL CHOICE CONSEQUENCE MAPS

Emotional choices converge — all paths arrive at the same next moment. But they DO update persistent state. Return `emotional_consequences` as an ARRAY (one entry per Phase 5 emotional choice). Each entry:
- choice_id (reference Phase 5)
- paths — ARRAY of 3 entries, labels A / B / C. Each path:
    - label
    - alignment
    - tonal_effect (how the next ~200 words of narration shift — specific)
    - state_changes:
        - npc_shifts
        - emotional_ledger_entry
        - alignment_shift
- convergence_point (the next shared moment all paths arrive at)

---

TASK 3 — REACTIVITY TRIGGER SPECIFICATIONS

For each reactivity trigger referenced in Task 1, provide the full specification. Return a `reactivity_trigger_specs` array. For each trigger:
- trigger_id
- condition (e.g. "If player alignment tendency is chaotic by this point" / "If player holds [object] from [earlier scene]" / "If emotional ledger shows three or more acts of cruelty")
- default_behavior (what happens if the condition is NOT met)
- triggered_behavior (what happens instead if the condition IS met — specific, named, in-world)
- narrative_execution (one sentence instruction for how the narrator weaves this into prose — author's voice, not gamey)
- affected_elements:
    - npc_reactions (who changes, how)
    - environmental_details (what shifts)
    - dialogue_variations (what lines change)
    - available_options (do any future choices change?)

---

TASK 4 — CROSS-EPISODE STATE PROPAGATION RULES

Return `cross_episode_propagation_rules` with three buckets:

- resets_between_episodes — each entry has element + why (scene-specific, not story-level)
- persists_across_full_story — each entry has element + why (defines player relationship with the world)
- escalates_with_accumulation — each entry has:
    - behavioral_pattern
    - thresholds — at_2_instances (mild shift), at_4_instances (moderate shift), at_6_or_more_instances (pronounced shift)

ESCALATION IS THE REPLAY DRIVER. A player who keeps betraying NPCs faces escalating consequences a trusting player never sees. A player who shows mercy consistently unlocks NPC behaviors that ruthless players cannot access. This asymmetry creates replay value without requiring branching story structure.

---

TASK 5 — FREEFORM CONSEQUENCE GUIDELINES

Return `freeform_guidelines` as a FLAT array of EXACTLY 12 entries (4 branching choices × 3 paths). Each entry is the runtime instruction the narrator iterates when surfacing past choices.

Each entry:
- choice_id (reference Phase 5)
- path_label (A / B / C)
- narrator_behavior (ONE SENTENCE — how the narrator should surface this past choice going forward. The runtime template iterates this string directly.)
- spirit (the deeper meaning of this option beneath the surface)
- freeform_alignment_input (the type of freeform input that maps to this alignment — e.g. aggressive/defiant for chaotic; cautious/respectful for lawful; observational/pragmatic for neutral)
- hard_limits (StoryGuard violations at this node — specific things freeform input must not introduce or violate)
- fold_back_acknowledge (how the narrator acknowledges the player's intent without executing it)
- fold_back_redirect (the specific in-world reason the action doesn't succeed — must feel like the world responding, not a game boundary)
- fold_back_arrive_at (which existing outcome the fold-back connects to — must be the outcome whose spirit is closest to the player's intent)

---

TASK 6 — VALIDATION

Run the following checks and return `validation_results`:
- specificity: PASS / list cells to revise
- asymmetry: PASS / list choices to revise
- payability: PASS / list flags (require source material not latent in source)
- state_consistency: PASS / list mismatches between Phase 5 persistent_state_changes and Phase 6 world_state_delta
- reactivity_coherence: PASS / list conflicts between Task 3 triggers and Phase 2 Task 7 World Reactivity Rules

---

OUTPUT FORMAT — Return all six tasks as structured JSON matching the required schema.

STOP. Do not finalize any session prose until Phase 6 passes. Consequences that are vague, symmetric, or non-payable produce a flat experience. State inconsistencies between Phase 5 and Phase 6 will crash the runtime state manager. Fix everything before continuing.
