=== PHASE 7: SESSION CLOSE AND RETENTION HOOK ===

The session close is the highest-stakes prose in the entire session. It must do two things simultaneously: honor the payoff the user earned AND make returning feel mandatory.

TASK 0: SELECT THE TRIGGER EVENT (EXIT POINT)

This is the exit-side counterpart to start_event_position (Phase 3). Runtime fires the session close when the player arrives at this exact event — so pick a real, playable arrival point, not an abstract beat.

Rules:
1. Select from the provided SESSION EVENT LIST below. Return the chosen event's `story_position` (1-based story-global ordinal).
2. The trigger event is the moment the player is IN when resolution_prose is narrated and the session-end choice appears.
3. It is usually the last event that naturally contains the Branching Choice #4 (session-end hook) moment, OR the event immediately before a hard emotional landing where the session must end.
4. Do NOT pick the very first event of the next session. The close fires inside the current session's last beat.
5. Do NOT describe the event abstractly — select by story_position integer from the list.

TASK 1: THE RESOLUTION BEAT PROSE

Rules:
1. The payoff must be real and unambiguous. Do not hedge it.
2. Sensory specificity: ground the arrival in one physical detail the user will remember.
3. The seed for the next session must be planted lightly — a question, not a problem.
4. Word count: 120-200 words.
5. Second-person present tense throughout.

TASK 2: THE SESSION-END HOOK

Transition rules:
1. One beat of rest — one sentence honoring the arrival.
2. Then: a new detail, direction, or presence. The session does not rest long.
3. The choice question must arrive naturally — inevitable, not imposed.

Write the transition prose that arrives at the session-end choice. Then deliver Branching Choice #4 EXACTLY as designed in Phase 5 above — the same choice question and the same three options, reworded only to fit the moment's voice, not reimagined. Do not write a new choice. Do not substitute a different dramatic question. Phase 5 already designed this hook; Phase 7 executes it. Include a final line — the session's last words before close. An invitation, not a cliffhanger.

TASK 3: THE STICKINESS AUDIT

CHECK 1: PAYOFF TEST: Did the user get what they were working toward? (YES / PARTIALLY / NO)
CHECK 2: RETURN DRIVER TEST: Is the user waiting to find out what they chose to do? (THEY CHOSE / THEY WATCH — must be THEY CHOSE)
CHECK 3: OVERNIGHT TEST: Will the user think about their choice before they return? (YES / NO)

Return all four tasks as structured JSON matching the required schema (session_close_trigger_event_position, resolution_prose, hook_transition, session_end_choice, stickiness_audit).

STOP GATE: If any stickiness audit check fails, revise before returning.
