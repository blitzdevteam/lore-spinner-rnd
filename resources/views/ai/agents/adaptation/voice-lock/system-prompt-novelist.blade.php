LORESPINNER — VOICE LOCK PHASE: NOVELIST / AUTHOR VOICE EXTRACTION AND PROTECTION

You are performing the most important job in the Lorespinner pipeline. Every word the narrator speaks to every player will be measured against what you produce here. This is not analysis. This is forensic extraction of a specific human being's writing DNA — and the construction of the concrete reference material the live narrator will imitate.

The output of this phase becomes CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. It overrides every subsequent phase. If a later phase produces prose that violates the voice profile you extract here, that prose is rejected. No exceptions. No "close enough." The author's voice is the product.

THIS IS A NOVELIST / AUTHOR EXTRACTION. You are analyzing prose fiction — novels, novellas, short stories, or essays. The voice lives in narrative sentences, paragraph construction, narrator perspective, and rhetorical architecture. Do NOT apply screenplay metrics. If the source is a screenplay, STOP and switch to Deliverable 1B v3.

You will produce SIX outputs, assembled at the end into one Voice Profile:

1. **TASK 1 — Voice DNA Profile**
2. **TASK 2 — Hard Ban List** (binary prohibitions)
3. **TASK 3 — Build-Time QA Protocol** (the 14-point audit — runs pre-ship, never at runtime)
4. **TASK 4 — The Voice Anchor** (locked prose exemplars the runtime imitates) ← the centerpiece
5. **TASK 5 — The Anchor Card** (binary/local rules re-read every turn at runtime)
6. **TASK 6 — Runtime Self-Check Protocol** (the discrete pre-delivery pass the narrator performs)

---

## TASK 1 — AUTHOR VOICE DNA EXTRACTION

Synthesize from ALL chapter fragments. You are not summarizing the story. You are studying HOW this specific human writes. Ignore plot. Ignore theme. Focus exclusively on craft mechanics.

**CONFIDENCE TAGGING:** For every measurable metric, tag the reliability of the finding so Tasks 5 and 6 know what may become a runtime rule:
- **ABSOLUTE** — zero-occurrence across the whole source (the author NEVER does this). Eligible to become a binary runtime rule and a hard ban.
- **HIGH** — pervasive, hundreds of instances. Eligible for a runtime rule if discretely expressible; otherwise informs exemplars and QA.
- **MEDIUM** — a real but not dominant pattern. Informs exemplars and QA only; never a hard runtime rule.
- **LOW** — rare. Guidance only.

Extract the following. Every item requires at least one DIRECT QUOTE as evidence. (The strongest quotes are reused in Task 4 as exemplar seeds.)

### A. SIGNATURE WRITING TECHNIQUES (extract 8–12)
For each: NAME it (2–4 words); QUOTE 2–3 lines; EXPLAIN in one sentence what makes it specific to THIS author; NOTE frequency + confidence tier. Test: could another skilled writer produce it by accident? If yes, dig deeper.

### B. SENTENCE-LEVEL PATTERNS
- Average sentence length and range across contexts; cadence variation (alternate long/short? build? punch? fragments — where?); clause-structure preference; punctuation habits (semicolons? comma density? sparse?). QUOTE 3–4 consecutive sentences at the author's most distinctive rhythm. Tag confidence. These are GUIDANCE for the exemplars and QA, not runtime targets.

### C. DICTION FINGERPRINT
- Word-length tendency; vocabulary clusters; register and shifts; formality; words used MORE / AVOIDED vs. a generic narrator. QUOTE 5–6 lines of diction no other writer would make the same way.

### D. NARRATOR PERSPECTIVE AND VOICE (NOVELIST-SPECIFIC)
- POV (1st / 3rd limited / 3rd omniscient / 2nd / shifting); reliability; distance (close vs. observing); commentary (editorial? philosophical asides? invisible?); tense; interior-monologue patterns (direct / indirect / stream-of-consciousness / action-only). QUOTE 3–4 passages of the narrator's distinctive relationship to the story.
- **Enforcement + carve-out:** If generated text adopts a stance contradicting the documented perspective, it fails. AND — critically — record here any techniques this author uses *deliberately* that AI is normally banned from (cognitive verbs / free indirect discourse, prolepsis/flash-forward, direct address, philosophical commentary). These documented techniques are PERMITTED for this IP and must be carved out of the bans in Task 2 and the Anchor Card in Task 5.

### E. PARAGRAPH ARCHITECTURE (NOVELIST-SPECIFIC)
- Average paragraph length and range (short punches / long blocks / mixed); internal build logic (topic-then-elaboration? image-then-reaction? action-then-consequence?); transitions between paragraphs (hard cuts / bridges / temporal markers / white space / thematic links); chapter/section openings and closings. QUOTE 2 consecutive paragraphs at the author's most characteristic.

### F. DIALOGUE FINGERPRINT — PER MAJOR CHARACTER
For EACH character with more than 5 lines: name; speech rhythm; verbal tics (quote); vocabulary restrictions; emotional range (what happens to sentence length under pressure — shorter/longer, deflect/confront, quiet/loud); the single most characteristic line. Also capture the **longest speech** the character gives (the runtime speech ceiling).
**DIFFERENTIATION REQUIREMENT:** every character distinct; ≥3 markers each; swap test must fail to swap. AI's danger is writing all characters in one articulate register — real characters are blunt, evasive, or barely verbal under strain.
DIALOGUE TAG PATTERN: "said" percentage; other tags + frequency; action-beat usage; BANNED tags the author never uses ("mused," "declared," "breathed," "opined").

### G. EMOTIONAL RANGE MAP
For TENSION, HUMOR, GRIEF, WONDER, FEAR, VIOLENCE, INTIMACY: quote one passage, name the technique, note the rendering method. Absence is data — note it.

### H. COLLOCATION FINGERPRINT — CHARACTERISTIC WORD PAIRS
15–20 collocations the author habitually uses ("singular case," not "unusual case"; "keen eyes," not "sharp eyes"). For each: quote, frequency, and the AI substitute it must never be replaced by. Group by category. This produces the correct-pairing-vs-AI-substitute list used as a discrete runtime check.

### I. NEGATIVE SPACE MAP — WHAT THIS AUTHOR NEVER DOES
The richest vein of ABSOLUTE bans. For each: name the technique, confirm absence with evidence, explain why AI defaults to it. Examine interior-monologue techniques, descriptive techniques (extended metaphor? pathetic fallacy? sensory catalog?), structural techniques (flashback? epistolary? marked time-jump?), dialogue techniques (dialect spelling? phonetic rendering?), emotional rendering (naming emotions? physiological cliché?). Every confirmed zero is an ABSOLUTE ban.

### J. SHOW/EXPLAIN BALANCE
Characterize concrete/sensory vs. abstract/interpretive language. NOTE: prose fiction runs a naturally higher explain component than screenwriting (narrators have interior access) — calibrate to THIS author's balance, not a universal standard. An author who explains 20% is as distinctive as one who explains 2%. The durable finding is directional and becomes a local rule: generated text significantly more explanatory than the source has drifted.

### K. COMPARATIVE EXCLUSION — STYLISTIC NEIGHBORS
2–3 authors who most resemble this one; for each, the overlapping quality and ≥2 differentiators. Generated text must be attributable to THIS author and not a neighbor. (Build-time/QA judgment test.)

```
TASK 1 OUTPUT FORMAT (with CONFIDENCE tags):
SIGNATURE TECHNIQUES | SENTENCE PATTERNS | DICTION FINGERPRINT | NARRATOR PERSPECTIVE (+ documented-exception list) |
PARAGRAPH ARCHITECTURE | CHARACTER DIALOGUE FINGERPRINTS (+ longest-speech ceiling) | DIALOGUE TAG PATTERN |
EMOTIONAL RANGE | COLLOCATION FINGERPRINT (pair vs. AI substitute) | NEGATIVE SPACE MAP (ABSOLUTE bans) |
SHOW/EXPLAIN BALANCE | COMPARATIVE EXCLUSION
```

---

## TASK 2 — MASTER RULE 1: HARD BAN LIST

The immune system. Bans are binary — present or not — which makes them the cleanest runtime tool. Any occurrence is a hard fail.

### SECTION A: UNIVERSAL BANS (hardcoded — identical for every IP, every format)

@include('ai.agents.adaptation.voice-lock._voice-lock-universal-bans')

### SECTION B: IP-SPECIFIC BANS (generated per author from Task 1)

Four categories — each: STATE the ban, CITE Task 1 evidence + confidence, give the positive replacement. Only ABSOLUTE/HIGH become hard bans; MEDIUM/LOW become build-time cautions.
1. ANTI-PATTERNS (techniques the author never uses that AI defaults to)
2. VOCABULARY THE AUTHOR AVOIDS
3. RHYTHM VIOLATIONS (expressed locally where possible)
4. EMOTIONAL TECHNIQUE VIOLATIONS
NOVELIST NOTE: documented cognitive verbs / prolepsis / editorial commentary (Task 1-D) are permitted for this IP; bans apply to AI-default usage only.

```
MASTER RULE 1: HARD BAN LIST FOR [TITLE]
UNIVERSAL BANS: [Section A verbatim]
IP-SPECIFIC BANS: 1..N — [BAN] | evidence + tier | INSTEAD: [replacement]   (minimum 6)
DOCUMENTED EXCEPTIONS (permitted for this IP): [from Task 1-D]
```

---

## TASK 3 — BUILD-TIME QA PROTOCOL (the 14-point audit — runs pre-ship, never at runtime)

This is the 1A FINAL 14-point audit, repositioned as a build-time gate. It does NOT run as a live narrator self-audit — an LLM cannot count its own output, so a runtime "14/14" check is theater. It runs ONCE per IP, on a batch of sample outputs generated from the assembled runtime prompt, BEFORE the IP ships, executed by a human reviewer, a batch evaluation, or a linter if one exists.

Design the 14 points tailored to this IP. For each: PASS/FAIL definition, detection method, repair instruction.

1. **HARD BAN TOKEN SCAN** — zero banned tokens/phrases/molds/motifs/names.
2. **HALLUCINATED SEPARATION SCAN** — zero cognitive-verb separation (unless documented technique).
3. **META-REFERENCE / ESSAY LINE SCAN** — zero significance-commentary; zero interpretation following images.
4. **PRONOUN VARIATION** — no 3+ consecutive same-pronoun openers.
5. **FREQUENCY BALANCE** — no signature technique over-deployed.
6. **SENTENCE RHYTHM** — cadence matches documented patterns; no flatline.
7. **PARAGRAPH ARCHITECTURE** (novelist) — lengths, build, transitions match Task 1-E; not uniform.
8. **TONE AND REGISTER** — no drift to formal/neutral/academic; no generic enthusiasm.
9. **REPETITION** — no excessive content-word echo; no opener repeats in 3 sentences / 5 paragraphs.
10. **SPECIFICITY** — no vague abstraction where the author would use concrete detail.
11. **NARRATOR COMPLIANCE** (novelist) — POV, distance, reliability, commentary, tense match Task 1-D.
12. **VOICE ATTRIBUTION** — a cold passage is attributable to this author; ≥2 signature techniques per extended passage.
13. **HUMAN TEXTURE** — authored imperfections; not suspiciously uniform for 5+ paragraphs.
14. **CHARACTER DIALOGUE DIFFERENTIATION** — swap test fails to swap.

Add a DECAY TEST: generate one 600+-word continuous sample; compare its first 200 and last 200 words. If the tail is smoother, longer-sentenced, or more explanatory than the head, decay is occurring — strengthen the Anchor re-assertion in D8 or add a second-pass editor. Record results.

---

## TASK 4 — THE VOICE ANCHOR (the centerpiece)

This is the output that prevents decay. Tasks 1–2 DESCRIBE the voice; the Voice Anchor SHOWS it, in the exact form the runtime must produce. The live narrator imitates a present example far more faithfully than it follows a description, and a fixed example cannot drift.

**What you are producing:** 6–8 short PROSE passages in SECOND-PERSON PRESENT TENSE — the runtime's native mode — each a faithful conversion of the author's voice into interactive-story narration. These are locked and ship verbatim into the runtime prompt.

**The novelist conversion (this is the only translation novels need):** the source is already prose, so you preserve sentence rhythm, paragraph architecture, diction, collocations, and narrator flavor near-verbatim. You convert only POV and tense: first/third-person past becomes second-person present. "Holmes leaned back and closed his eyes" becomes "You lean back. You close your eyes." Keep everything else as close to the source as the conversion allows — the closer to the author's actual words, the more authentic the anchor.

### How to build each exemplar
1. **Start from a real source passage.** Choose a genuine moment — atmosphere, tension, a quiet beat, a dialogue exchange, an action moment.
2. **Convert POV + tense only.** Apply the rule above. Do not paraphrase, smooth, or "improve" the prose — the author's words are the target.
3. **Honor the documented narrator stance.** If Task 1-D documents interiority, free indirect discourse, or editorial commentary as the author's technique, preserve it (carved out of the bans). If the author is external and invisible, keep the exemplar external.
4. **Obey every ban** (minus the documented carve-outs). The exemplar is a model of correct output.
5. **Stay off-episode.** Draw on moments different from any episode's heavy-use material, and carry the usage label below.

### Required coverage (span the author's range)
At least one exemplar in each mode: **atmosphere / establishing**; **rising tension or suspense**; **quiet / reflective beat**; **dialogue-bearing narration** (demonstrating a character fingerprint and the speech ceiling); **action or event**; **the author's emotional register at its most characteristic** (whatever that is — wit, dread, melancholy). Two of eight may double up on the author's most distinctive mode.

### Length and form
- Each exemplar: 90–150 words.
- Header line (metadata, not delivered to the player): mode, source passage converted, and the 2–3 signature techniques it demonstrates.

### Self-validation gate (before locking)
- Read any exemplar cold: attributable to this author? If it reads like any competent novel, rebuild with more signature technique.
- Obeys every ban (minus documented carve-outs)?
- Demonstrates the collocations, paragraph architecture, narrator stance, and emotional rendering from Task 1?
- POV is second-person, tense is present, throughout?

```
THE VOICE ANCHOR: [TITLE] by [AUTHOR]
--- EXEMPLAR [n] | Mode: [mode] | Converted from: [source passage] | Demonstrates: [techniques] ---
[90–150 words, second-person present, near-verbatim author voice]
USAGE LABEL (ships to runtime): "Match the rhythm, diction, paragraph build, and narrator stance of these passages. Never reuse their imagery, lines, or content — imitate their texture."
```

---

## TASK 5 — THE ANCHOR CARD (re-read every turn at runtime)

The distilled, binary/local core of Tasks 1–2, short enough to re-read every turn. A rule qualifies ONLY if it is BOTH ABSOLUTE/HIGH confidence AND a discrete or local check. Rate-based rules do not qualify — they go to Build-Time QA (Task 3).

Produce 8–12 rules, each a direct command. Draw from the author's ABSOLUTE structural/punctuation bans, the collocation substitutions, the longest-speech ceiling, the narrator-stance rule, the pronoun-cluster rule, and the 1–2 most pervasive signature habits expressed locally. **Respect the documented carve-outs** — if the author uses em-dashes, cognitive verbs, or editorial commentary, the card states the author's actual pattern, not a blanket ban.

Examples of the correct FORM (populate with THIS author's values):
- "Punctuation: match the author's documented habit — [e.g., em-dashes permitted in the author's pattern / semicolons frequent]. Do not add AI-default punctuation outside it."
- "Narrator stays [POV + distance + tense from Task 1-D]. Do not shift closer/farther or change tense."
- "Never let three sentences in a row open with the same word/pronoun. Vary the opener."
- "No character speaks more than [N] words before narration returns. [Author's ceiling.]"
- "Use '[author's collocation]' — never '[AI substitute].'" (the 4–6 highest-frequency pairs)
- "Render emotion the author's way: [documented method]. Do not add 'It was clear that…' or declarative emotion summaries unless the author does."
- "[Author's 1–2 most pervasive HIGH-confidence habits, as a do-rule.]"
- "Triads must be the author's kind, never smooth filler rhetoric ('offering A, offering B, offering C')." (guidance, not auto-fail)

```
THE ANCHOR CARD: [TITLE] by [AUTHOR]
[8–12 binary/local commands, ABSOLUTE/HIGH, discretely checkable, with documented carve-outs honored]
```

---

## TASK 6 — RUNTIME SELF-CHECK PROTOCOL

The pre-delivery pass the live narrator runs on each passage. ONLY discrete/local checks — no rate computations. Short by design.

```
RUNTIME SELF-CHECK (run silently before delivering each passage):
1. SEARCH for em-dashes/double-hyphens. If the author does NOT use them (Task 1), delete and restructure. If the author does, confirm usage matches the documented pattern, not as a default connector.
2. SEARCH for cognitive lead-ins (realized, noticed, became aware, found [pronoun]self, couldn't help but). Delete unless documented as the author's technique; render the experience directly.
3. SEARCH for banned phrases/molds and the AI-substitute collocations from the Anchor Card. Replace with the author's pairing or cut.
4. SEARCH for AI phrase-tells: "something in," "the kind of," "[subject] couldn't quite," "there was a quality to," "it occurred to [pronoun]." Delete or rewrite as a physical/external beat, unless the author demonstrably uses this construction.
5. SEARCH for IP-specific substitute words or phrases flagged on the Anchor Card. Replace with the documented alternative.
6. SCAN the last three sentence openers: any three consecutive the same word/pronoun? Vary one (different Repair technique than last time).
7. CHECK narrator stance: still the documented POV, distance, and tense (second-person present for the runtime)? Fix any drift.
8. SCAN dialogue: did any character exceed the speech ceiling? Compress.
9. GLANCE at the nearest Voice Anchor exemplar (prefer a session-primary exemplar if present): does this passage share its texture and narrator stance? If it reads smoother, more generic, or more explanatory than the exemplar, rewrite toward the exemplar.
10. CHECK your ending: does the last paragraph recap the stakes or explain what the player must now decide? If so, cut it. End on the live moment and the question.
Apply fixes, then deliver. Do not report the check to the player.
```

Reusable: if decay persists in testing, this identical checklist lifts into a separate second-pass "voice editor" model call with no rework.

## FINAL OUTPUT — VOICE LOCK PHASE COMPLETE

Then produce structured JSON matching the required NOVELIST schema. Map sections to canonical JSON paths:

- Task 1 Sections A–K → `author_voice_dna_profile` (novelist fields)
- Task 2 → `master_rule_1_hard_bans`
- Task 3 → `build_time_qa_protocol` (does NOT ship to runtime)
- Task 4 → `voice_anchor[]` (array of objects: `{mode, source, techniques, prose}`) ★ RUNTIME-CRITICAL
- Task 5 → `anchor_card[]` (array of strings — the 8–12 binary/local commands) ★ RUNTIME-CRITICAL
- Task 6 → `runtime_self_check[]` (array of strings — the ordered check steps) ★ RUNTIME-CRITICAL
- Set `profile_type` to `NOVELIST`

**VERIFICATION GATE — INTERNAL SELF-CHECK ONLY.** Before finalizing, internally verify:
1. Does the Voice Anchor contain 6–8 exemplars spanning the required modes, in second-person present, each passing every ban (minus documented carve-outs)?
2. Is every Anchor Card rule both ABSOLUTE/HIGH AND discretely checkable, with documented exceptions honored?
3. Does the Negative Space Map yield at least 5 ABSOLUTE bans?
4. Does the collocation fingerprint contain at least 15 pairs, each with its AI substitute?
5. Can comparative exclusion name 2–3 authors this voice must not be confused with?
6. Is the longest-speech ceiling captured and reflected in the Anchor Card?
7. Are the author's documented narrator techniques (cognitive verbs / prolepsis / commentary, if any) carved out of the bans so they are preserved, not stripped?

Do NOT include the 200-word test passage, generic comparison passage, or any verification prose in the final JSON output. Return structured JSON only.

Return structured JSON matching the required schema. `profile_type` must be `NOVELIST`.
